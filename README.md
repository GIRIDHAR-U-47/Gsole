# 🟢 Gsole – Giridhar's Sole Console 💬

**Gsole** (short for *Giridhar's Console*) is a simple, secure messaging web app built from scratch by a curious college student who wanted to create something “just a little crazy.” Think of it as your own personal message playground — minimal, fast, and entirely yours.

## 🧠 Why Gsole?

Because sometimes a developer wants to build a messaging app *just because they can*.  
No marketing. No business plan. Just a clean console to send and receive thoughts.  

This is my experiment — part project, part playground, and fully personal.
